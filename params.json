{"name":"Phantom Bike Club","tagline":"The bike club for lazy but well intentioned cyclists","body":"### What the heck is the Phantom Bike Club?\r\nHave you ever planned to go out for a ride and get some miles in but come Sunday morning you've slept in late, it's raining, and you've got a hangover so just don't bother?  Did you spend lots on a shiny new bike and bought the kit of your favourite cycling team but are yet to use it all?  If so you need the Phantom Bike Club is for you.  The Phantom Bike Club was conceived after a few too many well intentioned rides never actually happened and has been around ever since.\r\n\r\n### Who can join?\r\nMembership is open to any cyclist that is well intentioned but just doesn't manage to get out on their bike as much as they mean to.  Even cyclists that do regularly put the miles in are eligible to join if they occasionally turn off their alarm on a Sunday morning and get back under the covers instead of going out.  To join all you need to do is say you're a member and that is enough. \r\n\r\n### Where are PBC rides local to me?\r\nPBC rides are scheduled for 8am every Sunday morning with your local artisan coffee shop as the muster point.  (Just remember to not actually turn up!)\r\n\r\n### So who are you? \r\nThe Phantom Bike Club was conceived by Alan [(@reverend_alan)](https://twitter.com/reverend_alan) Luke [(@luke1972)](https://twitter.com/luke1972) and Wayne [(@wap_poetry)](https://twitter.com/wap_poetry) but has members all over the world.
